Code Book for Josh McNamara's analysis of the UCI HAR data
**********************************************************


==========
Background
==========
	This project was completed in accordance with the Coursera Data Science course requirements.

	The dataset is from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset can be found here:
	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/

	Descriptions of the dataset can be found here:
	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

	The data came from the following study:
	Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.

Analysis
========
	A tidy dataset was constructed from the original data repo using the script 'run_analysis.R'. This script creates a dataframe including the mean and standard deviation of each accelerometric measurement, called 'tidy_data.csv'. It also renames several of the variables to make them more readable. Means for each activity category were then calculated and presented in a second dataframe, 'tidy_summary_data.csv'.

=====
Data:
=====
	tidy_data.csv is a csv file of the whole dataframe
	tidy_data.csv is a csv file of the dataframe summarised by activity variable

	The first row contains the column names, and each subsequent row containes a unique observation.

	The column 'dataset' indicates whether an observation was a part of the training or test dataset.
		test
		training
	The 'activity' column indicates the activiy call associated with each measurement:
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

==========
Variables:
==========
	df
		This is the main dataframe with the mean and standard deviation values selected for each measure.

	YeOldeSummaryTable
		This is the summary dataframe with each accelerometric measurement reported as the mean for each activity label.

	labels
		This is a character vector containing the different classes of activity labels:
			WALKING
			WALKING_UPSTAIRS
			WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
			SITTING
			STANDING
			LAYING
	keeps
		This is a list of column names that signify mean or standard deviation measures, which were kept for the subsequent analysis.

	Other variables
		Other variables were used for indexing objects for facile subsetting, and are not consequential to the analysis.

================
Transformations:
================

	Source data:
		https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

	Transformations applied to the source data:
		* The source dataset was unzipped
		* Training and test datasets were merged
		* Mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted from the raw data
		* Column headers were given more intuitive and readable names
		* Special characters were removed from the column headers
		* Activity labels were applied to each observation in a humam readable format
		* Data were summarized in a separate dataframe as the mean of each measurement with respect to each activity label category
		* Dataframes were written out as csv files for downstream analysis
