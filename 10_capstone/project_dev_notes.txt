Project dev notes
=========

To do:
======
- Make the corpora generation kick out a training and test set
- Make a new test training divide-
	- Make a function go through 90% of the corpora and pick out the most frequent n-grams
	- Then test on remaining 10%
	- Check data type classes on these to make sure they are accepted by the prediction algo

- Clean up subsequent prediction model to accept new inputs
- Write a testing function that pulls a random trigram from the test set
- Write an eval function that tests the prediction algo
- Finish slides evaluating progress
- Write a contraction expander that works on the tokens?
- Expand contractions with grep before tokenization with tm package
